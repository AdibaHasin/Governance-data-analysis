This project analyzes governance trends across various regions and years using a dataset of governance indicators. Key objectives include identifying regional governance trends, exploring variability within regions, and investigating global governance changes over time.

Dataset

Source

The dataset includes governance estimates by country and year. Key columns:

countryname: Name of the country.

region: Region to which the country belongs (e.g., Asia, Europe).

year: Year of observation.

estimate: Governance score (positive values indicate better governance, negative values indicate worse governance).

GDP: Gross Domestic Product of the country.

log_GDP: Log-transformed GDP for scale normalization.

Key Analyses and Insights

1. Global Governance Trends

Analysis: Examined average governance estimates globally over the years.

Visualization: A time-series plot showed fluctuations in global governance.

Key Insight:

A notable dip in governance around 2005, followed by gradual recovery post-2010.

Stabilization near -0.1 in recent years, indicating limited global progress.

2. Regional Governance Trends

Analysis: Investigated governance trends over time for different regions.

Visualization: Line plots of governance scores by region.

Key Insights:

Europe: Consistently the highest governance scores, with steady improvement.

Asia: Gradual recovery post-2010, but governance remains below global averages.

Africa: Lowest governance scores, with slight improvement over time.

Oceania: Declining governance trend after 2005.

South America: Decline after 2000, with slight recovery post-2015.

3. Governance Variability by Region

Analysis: Calculated the standard deviation of governance scores within each region.

Visualization: Bar chart showing variability.

Key Insights:

Europe: Highest variability, indicating a mix of strong and weak governance across countries.

Africa: Lowest variability, reflecting uniformly low governance scores.

Asia: Moderate variability, consistent with a mix of developing and developed countries.

4. Top and Worst Performers

Analysis: Ranked countries by their average governance scores across years.

Key Insights:

Top Performer: Singapore consistently achieved the highest governance scores globally.

Worst Performer: Somalia consistently had the lowest governance scores globally.

5. Time-Series Analysis

Analysis: Investigated governance trends globally and by region over time.

Visualization: Line plots with confidence bands for variability.

Key Insights:

The 2005 dip and post-2010 recovery were driven primarily by trends in Asia and Africa.

Europeâ€™s steady improvement stabilized global governance trends.

6. Analysis of Governance and GDP

Analysis: Merged GDP data with governance scores to explore their relationship.

Key Insights:

Correlation:

Raw GDP and governance scores showed a very weak correlation, suggesting economic size alone does not explain governance quality.

Log-transformed GDP showed a slight negative correlation with governance scores, indicating that wealthier countries may still face governance challenges.

Visualization:

Scatter plots revealed clustering near lower GDP values, with governance scores spread across the range and no strong linear relationship.

Outliers:

Countries with exceptionally high or low governance scores (e.g., Singapore and Somalia) stood out for further investigation.

Next Steps

Deeper Regional Analysis:

Investigate specific countries driving trends within regions.

Explore governance disparities within Europe and Asia.

Event Correlation:

Align governance trends with global events (e.g., conflicts, economic crises).

Policy Recommendations:

Identify successful governance strategies in top-performing regions and countries.

Further Data Integration:

Include economic indicators (e.g., GDP growth rates) to explore correlations with governance.
